    <font color="#F0109B">I come from a humble family made up of my mother, Nor Aini Binti Mahmood, my father, Kamarul Nizam bin Zulkefapli, and four younger brothers. As the eldest and only daughter, I often take on a larger role in helping to care for my brothers and assisting my parents in various ways. 
    Both of my parents are self-employed, managing their own food stall. They work tirelessly every day to grow their business and provide steady support for our family. Witnessing their dedication, I deeply appreciate the effort they put into ensuring our family’s happiness and stability. 
    Every Sunday, we make it a point to spend time together watching Netflix, a cherished weekly tradition that brings us closer. My family is consistently supportive of my decisions, offering strong encouragement, particularly when it comes to my education. 
    My father is from Semenyih, Selangor, and my mother is from Jertih, Terengganu.<br>
 
    <font color="#F0109B"> During Hari Raya, we follow a special tradition of celebrating in my father’s hometown first, then traveling to my mother’s hometown in Terengganu the next day. 
    This custom makes our Raya celebrations more meaningful as it strengthens our ties with both sides of the family.All of my younger brothers are still in school, and each of them has a unique personality, which makes our time together lively and full of shared experiences. 
    As the oldest sibling, I try to set a positive example for them and am often their go-to for guidance on schoolwork or advice on everyday matters. Even though my parents are busy with their business, they prioritize our education and maintain a strong sense of family values. 
    The support we receive from them keeps our family bond close and ensures that each of us feels valued and understood.

            1 My best friend, Nur Afiqah Safiah, or simply Safiah, is someone who has been with me through all the highs and lows. 
            She’s a kind-hearted person who has always accepted me, flaws and all, and her support means the world to me. 
            Even though we don’t get to see each other often because of the demands of university life, she remains close to my heart. 
            Our friendship is a perfect example of the saying, "Jauh di mata, dekat di hati." 
            No matter the distance or time apart, I know we will always be there for each other, and I am incredibly grateful for her presence in my life
